I’m a Research Engineer at [Animaker](https://www.animaker.com/), where I head a focused AI research team, driving projects end-to-end — from prototyping Deep Learning models to deploying Production-Ready AI features at scale across products like [Steve.ai](https://www.steve.ai/), [Animaker](https://www.animaker.com/), [Picmaker](https://www.picmaker.com/) and [Vmaker](https://www.vmaker.com/). My work lies at the intersection of Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, and Generative AI, focusing on building intelligent systems that automate video creation — from Script-to-Live/GenAI/Animation pipelines and Talking Head Animated Characters to Video Matting and GenAI-powered video creation using Animaker 2.0 Pre-built scenes.

Before this, I completed my Master’s by Research in Computer Science at [IIIT Hyderabad](https://www.iiit.ac.in/), I was advised by [Dr. Vineet Gandhi](https://www.iiit.ac.in/faculty/vineet-gandhi/) and was associated with the [CVIT Lab](https://cvit.iiit.ac.in/). My research focused on Multi-Camera Detection and Tracking, specifically improving Generalization in Deep Multi-View Pedestrian Detection across diverse camera setups, changing camera positions, and orientation — bridging simulation and real-world performance (Sim2Real) by synthetically generating data from GTA-V and Unity game.

I’m passionate about R&D, translating research into robust, real-world AI systems, and I'm always curious about the intersection of Perception, Creativity, and Technology.
